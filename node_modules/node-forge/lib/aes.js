 * Performs initialization, ie: precomputes tables to optimize for speed.
 *
 * One way to understand how AES works is to imagine that 'addition' and
 * 'multiplication' are interfaces that require certain mathematical
 * properties to hold true (ie: they are associative) but they might have
 * different implementations and produce different kinds of results ...
 * provided that their mathematical properties remain true. AES defines
 * its own methods of addition and multiplication but keeps some important
 * properties the same, ie: associativity and distributivity. The
 * explanation below tries to shed some light on how AES defines addition
 * and multiplication of bytes and 32-bit words in order to perform its
 * encryption and decryption algorithms.
 *
 * The basics:
 *
 * The AES algorithm views bytes as binary representations of polynomials
 * that have either 1 or 0 as the coefficients. It defines the addition
 * or subtraction of two bytes as the XOR operation. It also defines the
 * multiplication of two bytes as a finite field referred to as GF(2^8)
 * (Note: 'GF' means "Galois Field" which is a field that contains a finite
 * number of elements so GF(2^8) has 256 elements).
 *
 * This means that any two bytes can be represented as binary polynomials;
 * when they multiplied together and modularly reduced by an irreducible
 * polynomial of the 8th degree, the results are the field GF(2^8). The
 * specific irreducible polynomial that AES uses in hexadecimal is 0x11b.
 * This multiplication is associative with 0x01 as the identity:
 *
 * (b * 0x01 = GF(b, 0x01) = b).
 *
 * The operation GF(b, 0x02) can be performed at the byte level by left
 * shifting b once and then XOR'ing it (to perform the modular reduction)
 * with 0x11b if b is >= 128. Repeated application of the multiplication
 * of 0x02 can be used to implement the multiplication of any two bytes.
 *
 * For instance, multiplying 0x57 and 0x13, denoted as GF(0x57, 0x13), can
 * be performed by factoring 0x13 into 0x01, 0x02, and 0x10. Then these
 * factors can each be multiplied by 0x57 and then added together. To do
 * the multiplication, values for 0x57 multiplied by each of these 3 factors
 * can be precomputed and stored in a table. To add them, the values from
 * the table are XOR'd together.
 *
 * AES also defines addition and multiplication of words, that is 4-byte
 * numbers represented as polynomials of 3 degrees where the coefficients
 * are the values of the bytes.
 *
 * The word [a0, a1, a2, a3] is a polynomial a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0.
 *
 * Addition is performed by XOR'ing like powers of x. Multiplication
 * is performed in two steps, the first is an algebriac expansion as
 * you would do normally (where addition is XOR). But the result is
 * a polynomial larger than 3 degrees and thus it cannot fit in a word. So
 * next the result is modularly reduced by an AES-specific polynomial of
 * degree 4 which will always produce a polynomial of less than 4 degrees
 * such that it will fit in a word. In AES, this polynomial is x^4 + 1.
 *
 * The modular product of two polynomials 'a' and 'b' is thus:
 *
 * d(x) = d3x^3 + d2x^2 + d1x + d0
 * with
 * d0 = GF(a0, b0) ^ GF(a3, b1) ^ GF(a2, b2) ^ GF(a1, b3)
 * d1 = GF(a1, b0) ^ GF(a0, b1) ^ GF(a3, b2) ^ GF(a2, b3)
 * d2 = GF(a2, b0) ^ GF(a1, b1) ^ GF(a0, b2) ^ GF(a3, b3)
 * d3 = GF(a3, b0) ^ GF(a2, b1) ^ GF(a1, b2) ^ GF(a0, b3)
 *
 * As a matrix:
 *
 * [d0] = [a0 a3 a2 a1][b0]
 * [d1]   [a1 a0 a3 a2][b1]
 * [d2]   [a2 a1 a0 a3][b2]
 * [d3]   [a3 a2 a1 a0][b3]
 *
 * Special polynomials defined by AES (0x02 == {02}):
 * a(x)    = {03}x^3 + {01}x^2 + {01}x + {02}
 * a^-1(x) = {0b}x^3 + {0d}x^2 + {09}x + {0e}.
 *
 * These polynomials are used in the MixColumns() and InverseMixColumns()
 * operations, respectively, to cause each element in the state to affect
 * the output (referred to as diffusing).
 *
 * RotWord() uses: a0 = a1 = a2 = {00} and a3 = {01}, which is the
 * polynomial x3.
 *
 * The ShiftRows() method modifies the last 3 rows in the state (where
 * the state is 4 words with 4 bytes per word) by shifting bytes cyclically.
 * The 1st byte in the second row is moved to the end of the row. The 1st
 * and 2nd bytes in the third row are moved to the end of the row. The 1st,
 * 2nd, and 3rd bytes are moved in the fourth row.
 *
 * More details on how AES arithmetic works:
 *
 * In the polynomial representation of binary numbers, XOR performs addition
 * and subtraction and multiplication in GF(2^8) denoted as GF(a, b)
 * corresponds with the multiplication of polynomials modulo an irreducible
 * polynomial of degree 8. In other words, for AES, GF(a, b) will multiply
 * polynomial 'a' with polynomial 'b' and then do a modular reduction by
 * an AES-specific irreducible polynomial of degree 8.
 *
 * A polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are one and itself. For
 * the AES algorithm, this irreducible polynomial is:
 *
 * m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1,
 *
 * or {01}{1b} in hexadecimal notation, where each coefficient is a bit:
 * 100011011 = 283 = 0x11b.
 *
 * For example, GF(0x57, 0x83) = 0xc1 because
 *
 * 0x57 = 87  = 01010111 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
 * 0x85 = 131 = 10000101 = x^7 + x + 1
 *
 * (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) * (x^7 + x + 1)
 * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 +
 *    x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x +
 *    x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
 * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 = y
 *    y modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
 * =  x^7 + x^6 + 1.
 *
 * The modular reduction by m(x) guarantees the result will be a binary
 * polynomial of less than degree 8, so that it can fit in a byte.
 *
 * The operation to multiply a binary polynomial b with x (the polynomial
 * x in binary representation is 00000010) is:
 *
 * b_7x^8 + b_6x^7 + b_5x^6 + b_4x^5 + b_3x^4 + b_2x^3 + b_1x^2 + b_0x^1
 *
 * To get GF(b, x) we must reduce that by m(x). If b_7 is 0 (that is the
 * most significant bit is 0 in b) then the result is already reduced. If
 * it is 1, then we can reduce it by subtracting m(x) via an XOR.
 *
 * It follows that multiplication by x (00000010 or 0x02) can be implemented
 * by performing a left shift followed by a conditional bitwise XOR with
 * 0x1b. This operation on bytes is denoted by xtime(). Multiplication by
 * higher powers of x can be implemented by repeated application of xtime().
 *
 * By adding intermediate results, multiplication by any constant can be
 * implemented. For instance:
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x13) = 0xfe because:
 *
 * xtime(b) = (b & 128) ? (b << 1 ^ 0x11b) : (b << 1)
 *
 * Note: We XOR with 0x11b instead of 0x1b because in javascript our
 * datatype for b can be larger than 1 byte, so a left shift will not
 * automatically eliminate bits that overflow a byte ... by XOR'ing the
 * overflow bit with 1 (the extra one from 0x11b) we zero it out.
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x02) = xtime(0x57) = 0xae
 * GF(0x57, 0x04) = xtime(0xae) = 0x47
 * GF(0x57, 0x08) = xtime(0x47) = 0x8e
 * GF(0x57, 0x10) = xtime(0x8e) = 0x07
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x13) = GF(0x57, (0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x10))
 *
 * And by the distributive property (since XOR is addition and GF() is
 * multiplication):
 *
 * = GF(0x57, 0x01) ^ GF(0x57, 0x02) ^ GF(0x57, 0x10)
 * = 0x57 ^ 0xae ^ 0x07
 * = 0xfe.
