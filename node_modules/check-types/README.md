## Why would I want that?

Writing explicit conditions
in your functions
to check arguments
and throw errors
is a task that
swiftly becomes tiresome
and adds complexity
to your codebase.

The purpose of check-types.js
is to remove this burden
from JavaScript application developers
in an efficient and robust manner,
abstracted by a simple API.

## How little is it?

25 kb unminified with comments, 7.4 kb minified, 2.5 kb minified + gzipped.

## How do I install it?

Via npm:

```
npm i check-types --save
```

Or if you just want the git repo:

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:philbooth/check-types.js.git
```

## How do I use it?

### Loading the library

If you are running in Node.js
or a CommonJS environment,
you can `require` check-types like so:

```javascript
const check = require('check-types');
```

It also the supports
the AMD-style format
preferred by Require.js.

If you are
including check-types.js
with an HTML `<script>` tag,
or neither of the above environments
are detected,
it will export the interface globally as `check`.

### Calling the exported functions

Once you've loaded the library
in your application,
a whole bunch of functions are available
to call.

Most of the functions
are predicates,
which can be executed
in a number of different contexts:

* `check.xxx(thing)`:
  These functions are basic predicates,
  returning true or false
  depending on the type and value of `thing`.

* `check.not.xxx(thing)`:
  The `not` modifier
  negates predicates,
  returning `true` if the predicate returns `false`
  and `false` if the predicate returns `true`.
  It is also itself a function,
  which simply returns
  the negation of
  its argument.

* `check.maybe.xxx(thing)`:
  The `maybe` modifier
  tweak
